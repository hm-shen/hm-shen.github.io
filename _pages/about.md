I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the [Industrial and Operations
Engineering](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/) department at the University of
Michigan and I am very fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Ruiwei
Jiang](https://sites.google.com/site/ruiweijianguf/). My research focuses on
**stochastic optimization** and **integer programming** with applications in
**power and transportation systems**. 

I obtained my master's degree from the [Electrical and Computer
Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) department at the University of
Michigan and received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Xi'an
Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).
