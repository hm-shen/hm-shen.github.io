    - title: A Data-Driven Approach towards Strategic Planning of Charging Stations
      year: 2020-2021
      description:
        - Developed a data-driven distributionally robust chance-constrained model for the strategic planning of charging stations
          for battery electric buses (BEBs), where the uncertainty in energy consumption and dwell time of BEBs are explicitly considered.
    - title: Projection Cuts for Two-Stage Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programs
      year: 2018-2019
      description:
        - Proposed a new type of valid inequality, called projection cuts, for Benders decomposition
          to significantly reduce the Benders feasibility cuts and accelerate computation.
